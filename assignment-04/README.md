1. I went to TIME.com's website in 2004. the graphics were not appealing at all. A column style navigation bar had lots of quick links. Mostly words with hyperlinks. The current website is much cleaner, has more pictures, colors go together well.
2. This GIT module has been very helpful. I can open view the source code for websites and have a general idea as tow what is going on.
