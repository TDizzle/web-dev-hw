universal, element, class, id selector types: universal selector is an asterisk.
Element selector is a general way of selecting all of instances of a certain element such as h1, div, p, etc.
Class selectors are another good way of selecting multiple of the same elements, but can be more precise and are styled with a period.
ID selectors are more precise or more refined where there can only be one instance of an ID tag, and is styled with a pound sign.

Color Palette: The colors of the American flag, red, white and blue are used with yellow lettering. I felt that the background should be be fairly plain in order for the colors of the flag, as well as the lettering stand out more. Red: FF000, White: FFFFFF, Navy: 000080
